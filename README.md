## Introduction

[Your Outdoors](https://suns-goods-1564630265ef.herokuapp.com/) is an interactive location based game designed to encourage people to go outdoors and explore their local area. It offers the user challenges in the form of a photograph, displaying a distinctive landmark or feature in their area. To complete the challenge they have to locate the feature and identify the spot the photograph was taken from. Users are awarded points when they complete challenges and can compare their progress with other users.

It's easy to explore the world through photographs on our phone without experiencing the places we're looking at first hand. This means we don't get the benefits provided by being in green/blue spaces, from the physical activity of walking, and vitamin D from being out on summer days. With Your Outdoors, you can find beautiful and interesting places in your neighbourhood with the added motivation of upping your position on the leaderboard, helping to motivate users to enjoy what they see in photographs in person.

## Target Audience

1. Outdoor enthusiasts: Discover and explore your local area through interactive challenges and landmark identification.
2. Active lifestyle motivators: Combine physical activity with outdoor exploration to stay fit and enjoy the benefits of green and blue spaces.

4. Photography lovers: Capture the beauty of local landmarks while engaging in a fun and interactive experience.
